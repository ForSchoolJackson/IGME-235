        <h2>Goal of users</h2>
        <p>The goal of this site is to show off my portfolio. It is supposed to be both pleasant to look at and easy to
            navigate. I wanted to have three different sections. One for the projects, an about me, and a place for my
            contact information. I wanted the site to be mostly vertical, so the user must scroll down to get through
            all the content. To make it easy to navigate, the bar at the top lets the user pick a section to jump to
            instead of scrolling though the whole page. I relize that I dont have many great projects to put up at this
            time, but as a continue taking classes, I will update the website by adding more and better projects. </p>

        <h2>extra notes</h2>
        <p>This prject was pretty challenging to complete, but I feel like a learned a lot about web design while
            working on it. I do still believe that my portfolio could look better, but overall I am pretty happy with
            it. In the future, I will continue to add and edit it.</p>
