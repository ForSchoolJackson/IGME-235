            <h1>Candy Catch</h1>

            <section>
                <h2>High Concept</h2>
                <p>Players attempt to catch as much candy as possible before catching too many vegetables in their candy
                    basket. They must move side to side to collect the pieces falling from the sky while avoiding the
                    vegetables.

                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>You play as a little ghost trying to collect candies and avoid vegetables.</p>
                <p>There is no real plot, other than a ghost just wanting some candy. The mood is meant to be
                    lighthearted and cute.</p>
                <p>The player is trying to help the ghost collect as much candy as possible before too many lives are
                    lost and the game ends.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
                <p><b>Graphics style</b> - Very cartoonish/cute pixalated style</p>
                <p>Pixal art for the background, ghost character, different candies, and different vegetables.</p>
                <p><b>Sound</b> - 8-bit. simple</p>
                <p>Different sounds will play for collecting candy vs collecting a vegetables</p>
            </section>

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                <p>Move the ghost left and right across the screen to collect candies in the candy bag and watch out for
                    vegetables.
                </p>

                <h3>Control</h3>
                <p>The left/right arrow keys are used on the keyboard to move the character
                    back and forth across the screen.</p>


                <h3>Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"</h3>
                <p>There will be an instructions screen after the user first presses start that will provide
                    instructions
                    for what the user is supposed to do. It will also display the controls needed to play.</p>

                <h3>Player learning</h3>
                <p>The player needs to learn how to move the character back and forth across the screen to collect the
                    candies that fall from the top of the screen, earning them points. Additionally, the player must be
                    cautious of vegetables falling in place of candies, as this will result in the loss of a life.</p>

                <h2>About the developer</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is <b>Jackson Heim</b>. I am a second year new media development major in the colllege
                    of
                    computing sciences. Although I am fairly new to coding, I have really enjoyed it. My interests
                    include simple programming, website design/development, illustration, and animation. My dream has
                    always been to make a simple visual novel game, but unfortunatly that didnt happen this time.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>When making this game, I started by getting a working object to move across the screen with the arrow
                    keys.
                    From there I switched between working on the code and creating the art that would be used in the
                    game until I had a working game with all the parts I wanted. I then added the sounds and made all
                    the screens look visually pleasing.
                    <br><br>

                    I used these examples from online as a reference to create my art for the art for the game.

                <h2>Extra information</h2>
                <p>Had to use chatGPT to get the font to load before starting up the application
                    refresh page when playing again.<br> Also used chatgpt to help debug when I was stuck.<br>Used some
                    of the
                    starter code from circle blast in this project, like for the utilities and making text and buttons
                    for the
                    pages.<br><br>
                    <b>IMPORTANT</b><br>
                    From what Ive tested, the game sounds only work on chrome. So please use chrome. Thank you. :)
